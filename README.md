# Infection simulation
Simulation of infection by spreadable diseases, originally created to simulate Covid-19.
This is uploaded after being written, and some parts of the code might be in Norwegian.
This of course has room for improvement, but I have not had time to improve. However, it does simulate dots moving, being infected, and then immune.
The screen is scaled for an old HP ProBook 650 G4, and therefore everything might not show up in the Turtle window.
## Colour codes
Blue = not infected
Purple = infected, but not capable of spreading the disease
Red = infected, and can spread the disease
Green = previously infected, and therefore immune
## This is not scientific
Numbers can be tweaked to make it more scientific, but do not under any circumstances use this to simulate Covid-19 (or anything else).
This is not made to be precise, just to be a fun side project.
